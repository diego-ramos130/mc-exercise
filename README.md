-Bob and Carol didn't pull from the master after the PRs were merged. They get merge conflicted as a result because git has no idea of knowing where the head actually is.

-They all start a new feature in the the master branch and then ACP to PR and get merge conflicted because they are working on the same file without branching.Â 

-Bob and Carol should have pulled after they merged to master, since it was an overall change of the master branch. Then, the whole group should have not been working in the master branch at for their next feature, and instead should have formed a branch for each pair.
