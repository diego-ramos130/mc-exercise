-Bob and Carol didn't pull from the master after the PRs were merged. They get merge conflicted as a result because git has no idea of knowing where the head actually is.

-They all start a new feature in the the master branch and then ACP to PR and get merge conflicted because they are working on the same file without branching. 

-Bob and Carol should have pulled after they merged to master, since it was an overall change of the master branch. Then, the whole group should have not been working in the master branch at for their next feature, and instead should have formed a branch for each pair.

Bob and Carol did not pull from the Master after the PR's were merged. 

Teds branch was updated at this point but Bob's was not, but they are both trying to complete a pull request. 

Alice and Bob start new a feature while they are in the master branch. Meanwhile Ted and Carol start another feature in the master branch, they both ACP and merge conflicts abound. 

They should have pulled after they committed to master then afterwards they should have created separate branches and created a pull request for those branches.

Bob and Carol didnt pull from b- master after the pull requests were merged. Ted has an updated branch and Bobs is not but they are both trying to send a pull request... MERGE CONFLICT. Alice starts a feature in the master branch and carol also starts a new feature in the master branch causing a new merge conflict. They should have all pulled from the master to sync up and then formed new individual branches prior to adding their new features.
